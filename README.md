# Delaware Json and Shapefile

This shapefile was processed by Professor Ellen Veomett and her student Arbie Hsu using the corresponding jupyter notebook.  As part of the cleaning process, small rook adjacencies (under 30.5 m) were changed to queen adjacencies.  Note that wee were *not* able to successfully nest precincts within counties for this state.
